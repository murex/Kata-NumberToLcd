# Number to LCD

## Instructions - Part 1

Write a program that given a number
(with arbitrary number of digits),
converts it into LCD style numbers using the following format:

```
   _  _     _  _  _  _  _  _  
 | _| _||_||_ |_   ||_||_|| |  
 ||_  _|  | _||_|  ||_| _||_|  
```

(each digit is 3 lines high)

## Reminder

Part of the purpose of this kata is to make you practice
refactoring and adapting to changing requirements.
