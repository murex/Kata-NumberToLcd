## Description

__Goal:__
Write a program that displays LCD style numbers.

This kata is organized in 2 consecutive parts.

### Description for Part 1

Available [here](InstructionsPart1.md)

__Note:__

* We will stick to digits '0', '1', and '2' because adding more numbers
  is repetitive work that does not provide additional learning.
* Please do NOT read the second part before completing the first.
  Part of the purpose of this kata is to make you practice refactoring
  and adapting to changing requirements.


### Description for Part 2

### For this Kata

This kata is based on "Number to LCD" kata available on [codingdojo.org](http://codingdojo.org/kata/NumberToLCD/).

We slightly adjusted requirements in part 2 in order to make it more feasible in a 2-hour session. Besides we believe this change also makes it more interesting in terms of refactoring.
